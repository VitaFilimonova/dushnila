## General info
A special device named "Dushnila" analyzes the values of temperature and carbon dioxide. If the set limits are exceeded, a warning appears that the parameters have been exceeded in the form of a background color change. The values are updated 1 time per minute. It is convenient to use the interface up to a resolution of 1550px since the layout does not provide a mobile version. You can check the project using the link to GitHub Pages.
